Scrooge was most famously drawn by his creator Carl Barks, and later by Don Rosa. Like other Disney franchise characters, Scrooge McDuck's
international popularity has resulted in literature that is often translated into other languages.
Scrooge McDuck is a fictional character created in 1947 by Carl Barks as a work-for-hire for The Walt Disney Company. Scrooge is an elderly Scottish
anthropomorphic Pekin duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet.
